# Sensor Data Anomaly Detection

## Design Challenge
We are creating a system to track health data signals and is able to separate system errors from concerning health events. This system wil lbe deployed in hospitals for tracking signals from many sensors.

## Feature Implementation
Implement a pipeline which checks the incoming datum for either a system error or a rule trigger (e.g. a drop in blood pressure past a certain value). Think about how the alerting and report system would work.
